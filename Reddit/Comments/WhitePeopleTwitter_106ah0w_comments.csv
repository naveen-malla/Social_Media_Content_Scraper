Psychological_Lime51,"Physicist here and I'm seeing some misconceptions so here's some physics facts:

1. Newton's 3rd law requires a (self propelled) rocket to fire matter (or anything with momentum) downwards in order to accelerate upwards. Therefore, there cannot be a truly emissions-free rocket. However, those emissions do not have to be environmentally harmful, and they don't have to be fuel byproducts.

2. We currently don't have feasible technology to serve as alternatives to fossil fuels in rockets. That doesn't mean that such a thing is impossible.

Edit: There are solid rockets, which use hydrogen and oxygen. And in the future these materials could be created using electricity and water. However, currently we source our hydrogen from natural gas (a fossil fuel).

Elon probably thinks ""Electric"" means ""No emissions"", because he's dumb. That's basically the only way to understand this, and my brain *hurts* trying to model this stupidity coming from someone who *sells electric cars and rockets.*

Which is just...Such an idiotic proposition that it's astounding. There are three or four ways to use magnetic and electric fields to create pulse, ranging from ion thrusters (which are actually *on spaceships*) to electromagnetic mass drivers that propel mass behind the ship, to some photon rocket designs. Literally all of these would qualify as electric rockets, that generate thrust from electricity.

You can even claim that some torchship designs that use magnetic nozzles to direct fusion products are, in part, a electric rocket because the magnetic field is effectively helping to generate thrust from the charged ions produced by the fusion.

But Mr. Elon Musk does not understand what the word rocket means. He barely understands what the word electric means. The only thing Elon Musk understands is what some marketing head tells him is the *marketing campaign* of Tesla-zero emissions.

Nothing else registers, so when someone says ""electric rocket"" he thinks they mean ""zero emission rocket"".

woronwolk,"Not defending Elon (he's a piece of shit), but the amount of people mentioning ion thrusters here is astonishing. Ion thrusters still require a propellant, that's where they take the ions to accelerate from. Usually it's some kind of noble gas, and they're very useful for small spacecrafts since they don't require a lot of it (just a few kilograms can be enough for several years). But it's still not an entirely electric rocket, because it's not just electricity that it needs to propel itself.

And no, [EnDrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EmDrive?wprov=sfla1) doesn't work either (see the section on theoretical inconsistencies and experimental errors).

There is one thing called photonic rocket, and it can theoretically propel itself with electricity only, but, if I understand it correctly, a solar sail is much more efficient as you can propel it with a laser beam instead of carrying huge generators that are more powerful than anything we've ever created, as well as fuel for them on board – and solar sail is technically not a rocket.

And anyway you wouldn't launch a photonic rocket or a solar sail from a planet, since either the thrust would be too slow, or the energy released would be too destructive.

So, as much of a stupid piece of shit Elon is, he's generally correct on this one, with a little asterisk on photonic rockets.",2023-01-08 11:53:46,j3giq59,t3_106ah0w,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3giq59/,71,Positive

Dalsiran,"Well, using pure electricity to make a rocket is impossible because you need to shoot something really fast in one direction to make the rocket move in the opposite direction. Ion thrusters are the closest thing we have to an electric rocket engine, and they aren't really ""electric"" engines because they still use propellant, namely xenon. They work by (in layman's terms) bombarding xenon atoms with electrons ionize them, and once they're ionized a grid of holes at the back of the engine accelerate the ions very fast out the back of the engine. Bear in mind this is simplifying how they work the the point of error, they are a lot more complicated than that, but that's the very basic concept.

So to answer the question of can you make an electric rocket, the answer is yes and no. Yes, you can make a rocket where the primary energy to propel the craft comes from electricity. No, you can't make one entirely electric because space travel necessitates some kind of propellant because in order to move the rocket in one direction you need to throw an equal amount of energy in the opposite direction in the form of mass, and since electricity has little to no mass, you need to use that electricity to energize some kind of propellant.",2023-01-08 22:30:09,j3j19uh,t3_106ah0w,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3j19uh/,3,Positive

I don’t mean a fuel engine with electrical components, but a fully electronic engine powered by battery (not fuel) that would work in space.",2023-01-08 06:20:28,j3fs46j,t3_106ah0w,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3fs46j/,19,Negative

Mail_Soggy,so i think he was trying to say that since electric power has very low thrust it would be implausible to use it as a rocket due to newtons third law. its not impossible but the amount of energy required to generate the thrust necessary means it is just not worth it. so yeah elon is not necessarily wrong but he could have been alot more clear.,2023-01-08 07:53:22,j3g07lf,t3_106ah0w,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3g07lf/,4,Positive
Simsalamima,"As narcissistic and whatever other mental diagnosis he covers he answered one line question with one line answer and didn't really say something wrong (with some extra background). Technically he is right, you can't throw electricity out of the rocket to propel it, hence the mention of Newton's law. Ion thrusters need propellant to actually move whatever they are bolted on. And there is quite a gap between escaping planet gravity well and accelerating and maneuvering in space, I'm not aware of any \*electrical\* tech that would manage to shoot a human in the space. He could answer a lot better and less ambiguous with a minimum number of added words but well, it's Musk and it's Twitter ...",2023-01-08 09:05:10,j3g5w61,t3_106ah0w,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3g5w61/,4,Negative
GrahamPeters,"OK hold up, so not to defend the dude and I'm not a scientist by any means, but unless I'm misunderstanding the science most of the electric rockets being talked about here require both electricity AND a secondary propellant of some kind. Like... an ion thruster uses an electro-magnetic field to give charged ions momentum and thus push the ship in the opposite direction to the direction the ions went, right?

So if all electric thrusters work like that then isn't he kinda right? Like, if the machine were designed perfectly then it would still require a non-renewable fuel source to work, unlike an electric car which in a perfect world could continually function and move with ONLY a steady stream of electricity.

Edit: Wait OK I think I got it? So you can produce photons indefinitely with just an electromagnetic field, right? I mean there's more to it than that but the only non-renewable resource being used in a perfect system is an electro-magnetic force, which can be indefinitely harvested through solar panels and shit.

Even though these photons have no mass, for reasons I do not understand they DO have momentum; that's why solar sails can work. Because of this, by the third law if you fire these photons out in a specific direction you'll experience an equal momentum in the opposite direction and will slowly (I assume really, really, REALLY slowly) accelerate. 

Essentially you're just like attaching a big matrix of like gamma lasers to the back of a payload, right?",2023-01-08 13:31:47,j3grglo,t3_106ah0w,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3grglo/,4,Positive

Electric Rocket Possible


Squidfizzy “Squidfizzy”
Would an electric rocket be possible 

Yes, electric rockets are possible and have been successfully developed and tested. Electric rockets, also known as electric propulsion systems, use electricity to accelerate a propellant, such as ionized gas, to high speeds to generate thrust. These systems are typically more efficient than traditional chemical rockets and can be used for a variety of purposes, including satellite propulsion and spacecraft propulsion. They are also being studied for use in interplanetary travel and for crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.




Squidfizzy “Squidfizzy”
Would Newton's third law effect the electric rocket 

Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that in order for a rocket, including an electric rocket, to produce thrust and move forward, it must expel some type of material out of the back of the rocket. As this material is expelled, it pushes against the rocket, producing an equal and opposite force that propels the rocket in the opposite direction. So, in this way, Newton's third law does affect electric rockets.

In an electric rocket, the action is the acceleration of the propellant by the electric propulsion system, and the reaction is the force that propels the rocket in the opposite direction. The efficiency of the electric rocket depends on how effectively the electric propulsion system can accelerate the propellant and generate thrust.




Squidfizzy “Squidfizzy”
Can it work and could you give me an example 

Yes, electric rockets can work and have been demonstrated in a variety of applications. One example of an electric rocket is the ion thruster. Ion thrusters use electricity to ionize a neutral gas, such as xenon, and accelerate the ions to high speeds using an electric field. The ions are then expelled from the thruster through an aperture, producing thrust. Ion thrusters are highly efficient and can produce high specific impulses, or the amount of thrust produced per unit of propellant. They have been used successfully in a number of space missions, including NASA's Deep Space 1 spacecraft, which was propelled by an ion thruster.

Other types of electric rockets include Hall effect thrusters and plasma thrusters. Hall effect thrusters use a magnetic field to accelerate ions, while plasma thrusters use a plasma, or ionized gas, to produce thrust. Both of these types of electric propulsion systems have also been demonstrated to be effective in a variety of applications.",2023-01-09 01:55:00,j3jvxmu,t3_106ah0w,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3jvxmu/,2,Positive

ex-procrastinator,"I don’t like Elon musk, but Reddit can be real dumb sometimes.

This twitter user is asking Elon musk if an electric rocket is possible. And people here think they’re asking him about ion thrusters?

No, they’re asking him if it’s possible to make a Tesla car version of a space rocket. Charge it and send it up without fuel. Ion thrusters need propellant and even then they are meant to be used when already in space, they have very low thrust.

Elon is saying a purely electric rocket isn’t possible because of Newton’s third law. Again Reddit loses their mind over how that has nothing to do with it. Elon so dumb lol.

Every action needs an equal and opposite reaction has nothing to do with rocket thrust??? To propel forward, you gotta send something backwards. You need propellant, can’t just use electricity.

robertojh_200,"So to be clear, an electric rocket engine is not possible because it won’t be able to escape the gravity well of earth because it can’t generate enough force (per Newton’s third law) to overcome the force of gravity pulling the rocket down down. By definition, rockets are combustion engines, ion thrusters—which accelerate reactions less propellant via electric charge—are not rockets. 

If you want to assume that The original tweet was asking about electric engines as Ion or plasma thrusters, then the tweet is pointless because we already have those. It could only be referring to rocket systems to launch vehicles off of the earth as a hypothetical, and in that regard, Elon is entirely right.

I suppose the ignorance here is discarding that idea based on the notion that they are trying to push mass without losing mass which I doubt is the case as anyone who's gone through high school physics knows that's not going to work.

consumercommand,"“rockets move forward by expelling gas backward at high velocity.

International-Cup143,"Can any scientists support my theory of a ""Domino engine""? Basically you have an engine made of circular wheels and at the end of the machine (at the ""launch point) you have them caving in to smaller cylinders. Then to start it you you flick a button that manually turns the first small circle and it ""domino's"" the rest of the machine. when it gets to the end it pushes back the force to the launch point and the system is locked to keep this machine in stasis. Then when you want to turn it off you flick the switch again and the first wheel stops the circulation. An advanced version would mean a pure kinetic engine that needs no charging or refueling.

IrisYelter,"I mean, everything about this hinges on what you mean by ""rocket"".

If it's limited to high thrust, there's no existing practical electric propulsion (aside from maybe a space elevator, and even that's mechanically infeasible) to get to space.

If thrust isn't an issue, there's not really an effective way to uses ***only*** electricity. I guess you could essentially use a gigantic flash light, but that's not gonna work very well at all.

Low consumption methods like ion engines, hall effect engines, and nuclear engines last an incredibly long time, but still use some kind of propellant like xenon or krypton.

And then theres stuff like solar sails which don't use any propellant and can go as long as there's solar wind and no significant damage to the sails.

I by no means think he's smart or a genius, but really our only way of getting around space (or really moving ***at all, anywhere, ever***) is newton's 3rd law, which in space *almost* always requires a propellant.

It's a pretty dumb way to interpret the question. The third law does always hold, there must always be something sent backward for a rocket to go forward. And for the foreseeable future we will be using a propellant of some kind. Hopefully not burnt hydrocarbon rocket fuel for much longer though.

cursed-being,"Technically yes. But the out put would be two low to get anywhere. To get into space at least with modern technology you’d need rocket fuel. 

However once you are in space using a bit more fuel you can start getting a momentum going for where you plan on intercepting your target, you can maintain it using electric thrusters which is basically a giant flashlight with such a high out put it pushes you, bot very fast mind you, but so far, until we make contact with aliens we only need to maintain a given speed rather than be able to outrun other space ships. So these electric thrusters should do the trick.

Plus using solar panels you can recharge them. Rather than burning your limited fuel supply. This can easily give you more fuel for landing and taking off on the target celestial body and then landing back on earth with more rocket to be re used if ever used before the structure fails from age.",2023-01-08 16:28:04,j3hed7o,t3_106ah0w,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hed7o/,1,Positive

Lexicon444,Not with current technology. Currently batteries for vehicles are quite heavy and very large. Also electric vehicles are limited in their range due to drastic temperature differences (a electric vehicle loses efficiency in extreme cold and heat. Space is really cold so the batteries would need something to prevent that from being an issue) as well as added weight. As such an electric rocket would likely be incapable of carrying large payloads (same issue is being had with creating electric semis) as such would be a waste of money.

Ok_Living1114,"Pretty much.

“The only way that a rocket can move (that we have discovered yet) is to expel mass in one direction to travel in the other direction. This is done by burning fuel that gets shot out of the back of the rocket. There is no way (unless EM drive works which i’m sure it does not in this context) to move with purely electricity, some exhaust matter is always needed.

That being said, there are ion engines that use noble gasses and electricity to gain very high efficiency propulsion. They are too weak for launches and can only be used in space, which is not Elon Musk’s main operating area. So Elon is right, the type of rockets that he is building that launch payloads into space will never be electric (not completely electric at least).”

JulesHaggard,"An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.

An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions.

Ion thrusters are categorized as either electrostatic or electromagnetic.

stargate-command,"So I am 100% on the Musk is a moron bandwagon,  but is he wrong?

Newton’s third law is about equal and opposite reactions, and regarding rocketry is specifically about the force expelled from the rocket to thrust it into orbit.  That force needs to be HUGE.  Can any electric source create that kind of thrust, to push a vehicle into orbit from the ground?  I don’t think so.  Can’t imagine how. 

Electric cars are doable because it’s basically just turning a wheel.  Electricity turns wheels quite well.  Could make an electric helicopter to get a vehicle quite high, but once you hit a certain altitude the atmosphere is so thin that spinning a wheel won’t let you get any higher.  There isn’t air for an electric machine to push downward to propel the vehicle upward.  

So what electric machine can exist that creates thrust?  Can’t be just pushing material directionally, because there is a point where no material exists to act upon in that way.  You need something that can be converted directly into a source of thrust, like rocket fuel.  Some material that, with a catalyst, expands a ton and can be directionally expanded to create that push. Electricity just can’t do that.  It can be the spark that is the catalyst, but not the acting agent itself

All that being said, an electric thruster can be used on a space ship already in orbit.  It’s the ground to space part that requires way more than electricity can provide.  Once you are far enough away from Earth’s gravity that it isn’t acting on the vehicle so strongly, a much less powerful thrust is fine.  Don’t need much to push stuff at that point.  But escaping the atmosphere requires so much force it is hard to fathom",2023-01-09 01:44:08,j3juea7,t3_106ah0w,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3juea7/,0,Positive

Keatontech,"Devil's Advocate: Hall Effect thrusters aren't completely electric. There's still a propellant, it's just inert. This might be a small difference but I'd say it's significant because it means Hall Effect engines can't just be recharged like an electric car. They still need refueling.

Having a pure electric engine would allow for solar powered spaceships that can keep accelerating for as long as they're near a star, which would be an incredible unlock. That might be what the original Tweeter was talking about.

Even with this distinction out of the way, Elon is still theoretically wrong: The [EmDrive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EmDrive) somehow seems to work using electricity alone. Plus, electrons do have mass so it's at least theoretically possible to gain momentum by accelerating them.

In addition, it would completely destroy itself due to the massively increased wear and tear at that power level. What Elon is so ineloquently saying is that current electric propulsion devices or systems designed like them will never be able to produce a sufficient action force that the reaction to the force achieves lift-off from the ground.

- Mighty efficient: Ion propulsion always seems to be the go-to propulsion technology for in-orbit adjustment or long distance trips to low gravity bodies. The Ion thruster is also capable of firing for long durations without needing to stop. 
Con of tech:
- slow: the reason why ion thruster fire for long durations is because the force it applies to push the spacecraft is no greater than gravity pushing a sheet of paper down on my hand! So not very strong.

-Not 100% electric : Xenon gas is ionized in order to give energy to the propellant in order to push the spacecraft. Once it’s out of Xenon, its dead

The only two prototypes to not bring their own propellant are sailing ships! ( sails in space! ). And it only works because of the bouncing of photons on a micron-thick reflective sail. It can cause a very small push to the spacecraft and making it able to change its orbit. Of course, if this sailcraft ever gets too far away from the sun, well it can no longer be pushed.

To conclude, I have to disagree with you that you can push a spacecraft to orbit without pushing something else away, it’s just not possible. I can agree that Elon is currently an asshole on the internet though. All in all, this meme sucks lmao get your facts straight Reddit!

He’s still wrong though, because the rocket equation is derived from a generalization of Newton’s second law (F=ma, but with varying mass too). The problem with electric thrusters is their propellant effectively has constant weight, and their energetic density is far too low for a rocket. The closest thing to an electric rocket is the Electron, which is more of a hybrid.

Trackman1997,"I would assume that Elon is assuming the question is if it’s possible to build a rocket that doesn’t rely on chemical thrusters, and while the Hall Effect allows for non-chemical thrusters in space, it is infeasible to produce rockets capable of going from ground to space anytime in the near future. Thus why hydrogen, methane, or some other propellant is required for rockets and thus can’t be made “renewable” i.e. electric anytime soon.

Newton’s third law is also technically a reasonable answer, though it doesn’t explain why Hall Thrusters are infeasible, but does explain why all rockets (even Hall Thrusters) require some form of propellant and can’t just be recharged like an electric car, though you need a lot of math to get from Newton’s third law to the rocket equation, plus Newton’s other laws of motion.

There are of course non-rocket ways of getting into space that avoid the rocket equation like space elevators, railguns, skyhooks, orbital rings, and likely more engineering solutions I am unaware of, and those that haven’t been conceived of yet. They are not rockets though. They are not subject to the rocket equation, do not function like a rocket, and if a rocket is like a covered wagon, all those ideas are more akin to roads or railways depending on how complex it is, expensive infrastructure to help get space into orbit. With only the skyhook being realistically plausible today and potentially economically feasible with the amount of material we’re currently throwing up into space.

At the very least calling a rocket that gets into orbit through chemical rockets and then uses the Hall Thruster effect to slowly burn through a supply of xenon, doesn’t feel like it should fit the definition of an ‘electric rocket’ even if it is using electricity to power the second stage.",2023-01-08 20:20:21,j3ifw1s,t1_j3fs7dr,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3ifw1s/,1,Positive

As far as I'm concerned ""electric rocket"" means no combustion and only electrical power may be used to generate the thrust. How you turn that electrical power into thrust doesn't matter as long as you avoid combustion.

Steam rockets are one of the most basic proposals for this. You can use an external electrical source to heat up the water in your tank, open the nozzle at the bottom and the water is ejected and instantly expands and turns into steam.

Rippedyanu1,"That was my understanding as well and as a propulsion engineer it made sense. No you can't have a electric rocket in the way the average person or pretty much anyone thinks of space rockets. Rockets right now are launched from the ground on earth. An electric rocket could not escape Earth's gravity. Ever. The thrust to mass ratio never works out to be even remotely close to what is needed to escape Earth. Maybe you could technically get around that with a mass driver but those are found to be pretty unfeasible as well so I'm gonna chalk it up to ""it's not possible and if it was it'd suck so much we'd never use it""

toramanlis,"that's a horribly faulty take. idk if u're defending it or not but it's horrible. that is not the law being the reason behind. it's just mentioning how the law is related to propulsion and then explaining how it's an engineering issue. batteries being heavy is the problem and it's not caused by newton's third law. and ffs, we have electric vehicles that lift off from the earths surface. many of us have drones at home which does exactly that.

the worst part is that there is in fact a fundamental challenge with electric motors as rockets which actually is related to newton's third law. if u wanna move a mass, you need to push against some other mass. conventional rockets shoot particles and gass at a very high speed by combusting the fuel and it makes rocket move the other way. since electric motors don't combust or shoot anything, they need to push the vehicle against the environment like pushing air back with propellers or pushing the road back with wheels. this isn't applicable in vacuum where there's nothing to push against.

the reason elon is being an absolute idiot here is that he doesn't know this not a problem anymore. there is an electric engine that works in vacuum. it shoots xenon gas backwards to move forwards.",2023-01-08 15:51:36,j3h91il,t1_j3h6ryl,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3h91il/,-2,Negative

DM_DM_DND,"Good question. The short answer is yes. There is an old joke about desktop particle accelerators-because that's what most modern monitors technically are. It's just that the things you are moving very fast are very small (electrons, photons) so all the things that make particle accelerators hard don't apply.

Technically, you can use this for thrust. Take a gas, run a current through it, you get ions. You can then subject these ions to either electrostatic of electromagnetic principles-the simplest way to understand it is that you're using a magnetic field to push the ions away. This generates thrust on you.

These ions are very light, but move very fast. They are thus *very* efficient, but don't move you very fast. Because the only forces involved are electric and magnetic you can run these off solar panels. All these components are light and low-cost but can't move to anywhere very quickly-ideal for near-atmospheric stuff or moving a small probe. Versions of them are used on satellites for stabilization maneuvers.

...Like Musks starlink satellites. Yes, Musk's company *owns and operates* electric rockets.

It's worth noting these don't really work in atmosphere very well nor can you fight against atmospheric drag and earths gravity with them, so they are basically exclusively used once already in space.

In contrast, most rockets use propellent that reacts chemically, because you can get a lot more thrust out of them quickly-to generate comparable thrusts with a ion thruster your ion thruster needs to be unreasonably large, at which point mass requirements require it to be even larger, ad infinity with no clear solution.

However these chemical rockets propel their mass away at comparatively low velocity compared to ions, which means they are very inefficient at generating thrust per energy expended-ideally you want to launch something away from you at the speed of light to get the best velocity per fuel expended. Chemical rockets are *terrible* at this per mass reacted, converting very little of the mass into energy and hence thrust.

So the core problem is that you want to launch a *lot* of mass away at the speed of light, and we can only launch *small* volumes at a time efficently. That's the key trade off in rocket design-you either get someone quickly but guzzle fuel in a chemical rocket, or you get somewhere slowly with an electric rocket. And because of how gravity and air resistance work launching requires chemical rockets right now, or you never actually get to space.

Some designs seek to solve this by using nuclear reactors to generate heat for *thermal* propellent. The proven designs heat up hydrogen gas with a nuclear fission reaction and then expel the gas, effectively reaching chemical rocket thrusts while being more efficient-not electric thruster levels, but better.

The final purely theoretical level of spacecraft propulsion completely avoids the thrust versus efficiency issue by going ham on the nuclear front-instead of using chemical reactions to expend products *or* electric fields *or* the heat generated by nuclear reactions, they *directly expel the products of a nuclear reaction into space*.

These designs have the advantage of producing huge thrusts with very efficient usage of mass, as nuclear reactions are very efficient. The problem is safety and feasibility. If you use a Fission reaction you are expelling *radioisotopes in your drive cone.* The simplest way to actually do this is to launch a nuclear bomb behind you, blow it up, and ride the shockwave. Yes, that's a real thing, Project Orion. The *more* crazy versions are basically a continuous Chernobyl meltdown being expelled out of the nozzle.

The much saner versions use Nuclear Fusion reactions, which are significantly less radioactively deadly, particularly if you used specific fuels and the right reactions. However our mastery of Fusion is barely up to snuff for earth based reactions, let alone space.

These designs are ideal-super thrusts, super efficient, common fuels and relatively safe (although the drive plume is a giant weapon). With them we could made the trip to the outer solar system in weeks, and zip to the moon and back in hours. We call these designs Torchships.

And this has been a quick summery of rocket designs for space travel.

As a final aside, the final Fusion Torchship designs are also technically electric rockets. They use magnetic fields to direct the reaction as it occurs *outside* the spaceship, combining an electric rocket with a nuclear reaction.

Oh, and why do I say you asked a good question? Because you acknowledged that you *didn't know the answer* rather then confidently saying something stupid, like Musk did. Rockets are complicated and the engineering sometimes counter-intuitive.",2023-01-08 07:36:35,j3fytmh,t1_j3fs46j,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3fytmh/,12,Positive

there's an issue with electric motors in regards of space travel that is actually related to newtons third law. they don't have anything to push against. it's not how much force they generate. they generate enough thrust to move away from the planet where there's air around to push. what do you think keeps them from keeping that up as they get further away? it's the absence of matter.

conventional rockets shoot back particles and gas backwards to move themselves forwards. newtons third law. u have to push something back to move forwards. electric motors don't have combustion that does that.

elon is obviously talking about that and he's an idiot for not knowing about xenon shooting electric engines.

and no, it's evidently not elon's response that xenon shooters aren't technically rockets. the categorization has absolutely nothing to do with newtons third law either. he could have said it, he would be right but he didn't.

You quickly run into the issue of the power generation and light emission device weighing more than the propellant used in an ion thruster (an 'electric' rocket that uses propellant) and it's power generation, so this has never been used for propulsion as it is essentially useless. 

However, if you don't generate the light onboard the spacecraft but use an external source (i.e. the sun) and instead reflect the photons you can generate thrust with a comparatively low mass. This is a solar sail and has been used. 

This all occurs due to radiation pressure.


Edit: Thinking about this even more, if you were to use solar panels to power the floodlight it would actually be less efficient than a solar sail if your thrust direction was possible with a solar sail. Solar sails transfer around 2x the momentum of the photon to the spacecraft (incoming momentum and the reflection momentum), but a solar panel absorbs the photon to generate energy (incoming momentum only) and with losses (solar cells having around 40% efficiencies at best being the major one) once you emit a photon again in any direction it will likely be less efficient than purely reflecting.",2023-01-08 09:03:00,j3g5q52,t1_j3g1ncx,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3g5q52/,5,Positive

OKura94,"You are correct that electronic propulsion does not generate sufficient thrust to overcome earth gravity, however that is not the definition of a rocket. What you are perhaps thinking of as a ""rocket"" is a launch vehicle, a platform designed to take a payload from the Earth's surface and deploy it in space.

A rocket, as defined in physics, is an object that generates thrust through jettisoning a propellant at high velocity. Electronic propulsion systems absolutely fit this definition as they are launching some propellant backwards to move forwards (for example ion drives using an electric field to accelerate ionized gases).

If the third law (for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction) prevented EPSs from working, then all rocketry wouldn't work, as it is this principle that causes throwing something backwards to push you forwards, no matter how much stuff you're throwing, or how fast you're launching it.",2023-01-08 21:31:58,j3iryqu,t1_j3inx5r,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3iryqu/,0,Positive

TommyTuttle,"He’s referring to the fact that rockets work by accelerating fuel rearward, which propels the rocket forward by Newton’s third law. If you have nothing expendable to throw out the back of the craft, you don’t have a rocket. 

Note that there are other ways to possibly propel a spaceship, but that wasn’t the question. They asked about a rocket. It’s indeed completely impossible for exactly the reason he says. 

And for all means of propulsion, Newton’s third law will be the biggest problem to work around. How do you push a spacecraft around when there’s nothing to push against. 

Electric propulsion could be possible but not yet. Electric rocket is a non-starter.",2023-01-08 18:23:22,j3hwkhk,t1_j3hmgpf,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hwkhk/,2,Negative
TommyTuttle,"The question as written, it is indeed impossible. 

Note that the question does not ask if electric space propulsion is possible. That, we can’t know the answer and we can’t categorically say it’s impossible, as you say.

But that wasn’t the question. They asked about an electric *rocket*, and an electric rocket for space use is completely and obviously impossible. A rocket pushes spent fuel backward and the rocket moves forward thanks to Newton’s third law. Electric motors, having no fuel to push out the back, would need to push against something. In space, there’s nothing. Even if you could make it work in air, it wouldn’t work in space. For a rocket to work, you need something to react against. No expendable material leaving the rocket, no forward motion. 

So electric space travel could conceivably be possible, but we currently have no idea how. And we know for sure that it won’t be by means of a rocket.",2023-01-08 18:06:02,j3htpym,t1_j3hmzlf,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3htpym/,3,Negative

1: Space is not a total vacuum, though there are areas that get about as close as we see in nature, that said there aren't discrete ""zones"" where matter exists here, but not over there. Even our definition of the ""edge of space"" is arbitrary because the atmosphere just gradually becomes thinner and thinner until it's indistinguishable from the rest of interplanetary space.

You're still losing propellant over time, you're just using the laws of electromagnetism to accelerate the propellant rather than thermodynamics.

Wasting_Time272,"Aerospace engineer here. Hall thrusters would never be able to provide the thrust to reach escape velocity from the surface of earth. The rocket equation forces a trade off between the highly efficient electric propulsion systems and the high thrust chemical systems. You will always have to trade efficiency for thrust and a hall thruster would need to be powered by unobtainium to produce sufficient thrust for lift off. In addition, it would completely destroy itself due to the massively increased wear and tear at that power level. What Elon is so ineloquently saying is that current electric propulsion devices or systems designed like them will never be able to produce a sufficient action force that the reaction to the force achieves lift-off from the ground.

Ghost-of-melbourne,"Lmao yea. 

Hall thrusters have been flying in space since December 1971, when the Soviet Union launched an SPT-50 on a Meteor satellite.[26] Over 240 thrusters have flown in space since that time, with a 100% success rate.[27] Hall thrusters are now routinely flown on commercial LEO and GEO communications satellites, where they are used for orbital insertion and stationkeeping.
The first[failed verification] Hall thruster to fly on a western satellite was a Russian D-55 built by TsNIIMASH, on the NRO's STEX spacecraft, launched on October 3, 1998.[28]
The solar electric propulsion system of the European Space Agency's SMART-1 spacecraft used a Snecma PPS-1350-G Hall thruster.[29] SMART-1 was a technology demonstration mission that orbited the Moon. This use of the PPS-1350-G, starting on September 28, 2003, was the first use of a Hall thruster outside geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO). Like most Hall thruster propulsion systems used in commercial applications, the Hall thruster on SMART-1 could be throttled over a range of power, specific impulse, and thrust.[30] It has a discharge power range of 0.46–1.19 kW, a specific impulse of 1,100–1,600 s and thrust of 30–70 mN.

#Many small satellites of the SpaceX Starlink cluster use krypton-fueled Hall thrusters for position-keeping and deorbiting.[17]
Tiangong space station is fitted with Hall-effect thrusters. Tianhe core module is propelled by both chemical thrusters and four ion thrusters,[31] which are used to adjust and maintain the station's orbit. The development of the Hall-effect thrusters is considered a sensitive topic in China, with scientists ""working to improve the technology without attracting attention"".[citation needed] Hall-effect thrusters are created with crewed mission safety in mind with effort to prevent erosion and damage caused by the accelerated ion particles. A magnetic field and specially designed ceramic shield was created to repel damaging particles and maintain integrity of the thrusters. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the ion drive used on Tiangong has burned continuously for 8,240 hours without a glitch, indicating their suitability for the Chinese space station's designated 15-year lifespan.[32] This is the world's first Hall thruster on a human-rated mission.[33]
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) granted exclusive commercial licensing to Apollo Fusion, led by Mike Cassidy, for its Magnetically Shielded Miniature (MaSMi) Hall thruster technology.[34] In January 2021, Apollo Fusion announced they had secured a contract with York Space Systems for an order of its latest iteration named the ""Apollo Constellation Engine"".[35]
The NASA mission to the asteroid Psyche will utilize xenon gas Hall thrusters.[36] The electricity will come from the craft's 75 square meter solar panels.[37]
NASA's first Hall thrusters on a human-rated mission will be a combination of 6 kW Hall thrusters provided by Busek and NASA Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) Hall thrusters. They will serve as the primary propulsion on Maxar's Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) for the Lunar Gateway under NASA's Artemis program.[38] The high specific impulse of Hall thrusters will allow for efficient orbit raising and station keep for the Lunar Gateway's polar near-rectilinear halo orbit",2023-01-08 11:56:03,j3giwu7,t1_j3futcj,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3giwu7/,10,Positive

My understading is that hall thrusters aren't able to produce even near the required amount of thrust to leave he atmosphere and are only used to adjust the course of satellites.

This is where Elon's reference to Newtons third law also comes in; The mass of the batteries required to generate the power to leave the atmosphere would greatly outweigh the thrust the thrusters would be able to produce (the other force is greater than the countering force). This is also why electric semi trucks won't work. The batteries weigh so much that the trucks can't be loaded with anyhting else but batteries to achieve a long enough range.

Sure, but the elections have to be ejected from the rocket to create thrust, and this would quickly build up a large positive charge which would attract electrons and prevent them from being ejected. So this doesn't work as a rocket design, however there is a rocket design that can run solely on electricity: the [Photon Rocket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_rocket).

thebenshapirobot,"I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

>Let’s say your life depended on the following choice today: you must obtain either an affordable chair or an affordable X-ray. Which would you choose to obtain? Obviously, you’d choose the chair. That’s because there are many types of chair, produced by scores of different companies and widely distributed. You could buy a $15 folding chair or a $1,000 antique without the slightest difficulty. By contrast, to obtain an X-ray you’d have to work with your insurance company, wait for an appointment, and then haggle over price. Why? Because the medical market is far more regulated — thanks to the widespread perception that health care is a “right” — than the chair market. Does that sound soulless? True soullessness is depriving people of the choices they require because you’re more interested in patting yourself on the back by inventing rights than by incentivizing the creation of goods and services. In health care, we could use a lot less virtue signaling and a lot less government. Or we could just read Senator Sanders’s tweets while we wait in line for a government-sponsored surgery — dying, presumably, in a decrepit chair.

MariosCode,"""is an electric rocket possible"", asking elon musk

probably not asking him to explain ion thrusters or something that already exists. More likely they are asking if he can make an electric rocket like his electric cars. Something that doesn't need fuel, just a recharge.

ion thrusters still need propellant. They just use electricity to use that propellant very efficiently so that the fuel lasts the expected lifetime of the satellite. 

Also they are very low thrust, not something used to launch a rocket. They are used when an object is already in space.

the newtons third law thing is saying every action needs an equal and opposite reaction.

Tha_GinjaNinja,Because they’re not solely electric they’re still using a propellant of sorts to run(newtons law). Plus they will most certainly in any form of the technology afaik never work to get to orbital velocity.  They’re all used once your orbital velocity is achieved. The issue lies here in the interpretation of the original question     For many celestial bodies you need a very high power short burst release to get to orbital velocity which can’t be achieved by purely electric(still using propellants) at that point when you’re now more worried about efficiency and can take your time to up the velocity you can start using electric based variants.,2023-01-08 13:53:41,j3gtrr9,t1_j3gkl5j,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3gtrr9/,10,Positive

It’s not impossible either, but a business/financial decision is also being factored into this. I am sure if he wanted to, he could really figure out a way. But I think using fission will be implemented in rockets before electric energy would.

TheLantean,"Hydrogen as rocket fuel has fallen out of favor because of the low density, even in liquid form. This requires you to build a larger rocket, and therefore heavier because of the extra material needed to support the structure. 

It's also hard (read: expensive) to work with, the tiny molecule is prone to leaking through most materials, reacting with the container and seals, and must be kept at cryogenic temperatures to stay in liquid form. 

The trending fuel today is liquid methane, although it's not as good as hydrogen for specific impulse it's much denser than liquid hydrogen, has better specific impulse than kerosene (aka RP-1), and doesn't create soot deposits making it better for reusable rockets. 

It's easier to work with because it's less reactive, less leaky, and doesn't need to be chilled as much (−161°C vs −253°C for liquid hydrogen).

DM_DM_DND,"Not with honest intent. An ion thruster is fundamentally different from an electric propeller or turbine.

It *is* fundamentally the same operation as a rocket or jet. All operate using the same principle-internal reactions add impulse to propellent, sending it in X direction and  the ship in -X direction. 

In rocket engines the propellants are chemicals which are allowed to react, adding impulse away from the reaction nozzle. In an Ion Engine the propellants are Ions which are given impulse by magnetic fields or the coulomb force. 

Both use propellent, and both can be classified as working according to the same principles as such. You can call that a rocket, or reserve that for chemical systems, but then the reason it's not valid is just terminological. In that case you can say that electrical *thrusters* exist, but no electrical *rockets*. 

In contrast, propellers and turbines work via a completely different method that only works in a fluid and has no relation to the mechanisms of ion thrusters. The *only* similarity is that they generate thrust from electricity. 

Hence while my original statements do appear to work for trying to equate propellers and turbines with ion engines too, they would be ignoring vital context to their function.

TheRealStepBot,"But that’s the part everyone misses here. Rockets are “weak” at a solar system scale not because of the energy they need to be able to move their own mass. Even the weakest rockets are very powerful by that metric. 

They are massive and weak because they recursively need to carry extra energy to cart all that extra reaction mass.

A purely electric rocket that directly converts energy to momentum is not currently possible according to physics.

Merely using electricity to accelerate a reaction mass like an inert gas’s is a thing and is widely used in in space flight for maneuvering once in space, but due to the mass penalties involved in carrying a fixed mass power source they can’t be used to replace chemical rockets for the part of the flight most people think of as being rocket driven, namely takeoff from a gravity well.

Hence it’s accurate to say that electric rockets either can’t exist or can’t be used to replace chemical rockets in the atmosphere where drag is high and speed is low.

robertojh_200,"Xenon engines do not generate enough thrust to overcome the gravity well of earth. They have an extremely high specific impulse—which is a measure of The amount of thrust divided by fuel usage rate, basically a measure of fuel efficiency— and therefore can get up to extremely high speeds in a vacuum over an extended period of time, faster total velocities than even chemical rockets can achieve. Similar electric engines are used in starlink satellites to maintain their orbits; Elon knows about them. 

What they’re talking about here are rockets, launch platforms designed to escape the gravity well earth, and there is no such thing as an electric engine that can generate thrust enough to escape the gravity well. Chemical rockets have relatively lower specific impulses compared to electric engines, because they aren’t as fuel efficient, but they have extremely high thrust relative to electric engines. You could fire a xenon engine for two weeks and it will never budge the rocket it’s trying to lift off the pad. Do the same in space and it’ll be flying to Saturn; but you need a rocket to get it into space first. 

The third law of motion is the governing law dictating rocketry on earth. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction and that equal and opposite reaction needs to be more powerful than the force of gravity pulling the rocket back down to earth or else it simply won’t move.

It just has to throw any object with mass out the back. So obviously this wasnt the way he interpretted the questionIf the question was about a rocket that can reach space then no it is not possible using currently known technology because the amount of thrust provided by ion thrusters is not enough to lift the ion thruster itself off the ground.In order for it to be possible you'd have to develop new ion thruster technology that is much much lighter, energy storage that is exxxxxxtreemely significantly denser than anything we have to day - proabably anti matter or some sort of fusion engine and on top of that be able to convert that fusion energy to electric energy without adding significant weight.

so no its not possible",2023-01-08 17:55:20,j3hs03g,t1_j3hly61,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hs03g/,1,Positive

At present I think ion drives are still pretty weak and the mass of the rocket is not irrelevant in space it still takes the same equal and opposite force to propel mass regardless of gravity, its just that in a gravity well the acceleration of gravity also needs to be applied to the rocket meaning you need a lot more thrust. In space all that means is that the drive will take longer to accelerate and decelerate meaning travel times are longer.

CryonautX,"Newton's third law is a major part of what makes rocket science so difficult. It's definitely a lot more relevant to discuss Newton's third law for a rocket compared to a car. This is because rockets have a very difficult task of moving in space which is a vacuum. A car has an easy time moving because it applies a force to the ground and the ground pushes back, moving the car forward. 

Rockets are in a vacuum, they have nothing in their environment to apply a force to which also means there is nothing to apply a force to the rocket and  move it. So they have to bring things to push with them, the reaction mass. Rockets are essentially giant fuel tanks. How they move in space is by burning the fuel and pushing all the mass the rocket brought with it out and the reaction mass will in return push the rocket forward.  So you can see how replacing this reaction mass with electricity can be tricky. But with all that said, we already have solar powered ion thrusters that are commonly used for small positioning adjustments in space. They basically push out ions rather than burning fuel to get the pushback. Making an ion thruster powerful enough to launch a rocket out of Earth is however inconceivable today. Ion thrusters also need a vacuum to work so that's another challenge.

There are other ideas that can be explored like having a spacecraft with a sail attached and you move the spacecraft with a laser from earth pushing the sail. This would however technically not be a rocket.

So to address what Elon said, he is technically wrong in that ion thrusters are electric rockets and already exist. But at the same time, I feel he might be answering the question: can an electric powered vehicle enter Orbit from earth? Answer to that as far as we can tell so far is no. Because we don't have a good way to get strong thrust without a mass source in a vacuum regardless of how much energy you hold in the form of electricity.",2023-01-08 18:40:34,j3hzgay,t1_j3gfrij,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hzgay/,1,Positive
Gdjica,"He was asked the question exactly because his company makes electric cars. It is not a good comparison because there is no air in space, no ground, no nothing to push against like a car does. No need to escape the gravity, either.

theonewhoknocksforu,"Of course it’s important, but the question is, how can you create thrust with an electric power source. Existing rocket engines are burning highly reactive fuels to create thrust. Electric powered engines need to create thrust by using some form of electrostatic or electromagnetic force, or by creating a stream of charged particles, like an ion thruster. These are all approaches that NASA is current using for deep space systems, but they aren’t practical yet for earth to space engines. They will be eventually.

So if rocket’s weight is more than the force acting on the rocket through thrust, the rocket doesn’t move.

Yes, rockets rely on Newton's 3rd law. It's how they function, by ejecting mass out the exhaust to generate a forwards thrust.

Including Ion rocket engines, which the Hall Effect thrusters fall under. They eject ions out the exhaust, and Hall Effect thrusters use electricity to expel those ions at speed.

Saying that electric rockets ""aren't possible because of Newton's 3rd Law"" is ridiculous, because electric rocket engines are perfectly compliant with Newton's 3rd Law and are proven to function just fine.

He is actually correct in that current Ion Engines do not have the Thrust capabilities to carry a rocket to orbit (*they are much better in terms of specific impulse, so they are much better to use as efficient, always-running propulsion for the long journey from Earth to destination in order to get up to speed*), but to completely dismiss electric rockets on that notion is dumb, almost as dumb as his ""3rd law"" crap.",2023-01-08 09:53:16,j3g9k6u,t1_j3g8btr,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3g9k6u/,23,Positive

Snoo61755,"Aye, if we're spitballing, there's definitely quite a few theories.

The railgun approach is definitely funny -- reminiscient of how we thought space travel would be like before rockets. The issue is atmospheric drag, with the 'bullet' suffering from air friction on its way to orbit, slowing it down and heating it up. Oh, and the acceleration would kill any human passengers -- it'd need an awful long cannon, ideally one that starts extremely high up, in order not to kill an occupant.

The other approach is a jet engine, which has the opposite problem: it can be purely electric and generates thrust through air flow, allowing it to fly in atmosphere, but struggles the higher one goes and ceases to function when the air is too thin to work with.

Even if they aren't feasible, I feel like the entire point of scientific progress is to solve problems by working around constraints. It's not about breaking the laws of physics, but using them. You got Newton's third, that's a *constraint*, not a reason to give up.

If you could get the 'railgun' into space, you could use electricity to propel an object in one direction and then move in another, that object being thrown backwards does not have to be rocket fuel. Ah, but where to find matter to keep flinging backwards if you need to change course?

toramanlis,"what are you doing? is this the world's most boring trolling attempt?

yes xenon engines have low thrust, yes newton's law is central in rocketry. who said otherwise? have you read my comment?

newton's law is not what keeps the xenon engines' thrust low. or any other electric propulsion system's for that matter.

what is wrong with you. even your connection with newton's third law and rocketry is wrong. there indeed is a tight connection and it's not what you said.

overcoming gravity is not about an equal reaction. it's about the first and second law. the third law is the only one that isn't about overcoming gravity. third law comes into play when we are talking about pushing against something. exactly where xenon engines don't have a problem.

there's absolutely no causation between electric propulsion being incapable of replacing the conventional rockets. none. they are both tightly related to rocketry and that's not what causation is.

i'll make this simple and won't engage any further unless u say something relevant. i can't waste my time explaining the same thing to you where you won't either challenge or accept it. quit throwing random info

1. what is or is not a rocket is not dictated by newton's third law
2. xenon engines' thrust is not limited by newton's third law
3. electric motors being heavy is not caused by newton's third law
4. what newton's third law prevents is conventional electric motors' capability to propel a vehicle in vacuum
5. elon's reply attributes absence of electric rockets to newton's third law
6. newtons third law does not limit take off from the surface because we have electric vehicles that take off from surface
7. newton's third law does not limit keeping electric propulsion until a steady orbit, engineering limitations keep the weight of the batteries and engines too high
8. newton's third law does not prevent space travel, xenon engines are invented
9. newton's third law doesn't even cause electric propulsion in vacuum slow. it is also an engineering limitation


again, i won't respond if you don't dispute or accept the answer you got. wasted enough time


tldr;
1. newton's third law doesn't prevent electric vehicles from flying. (drones etc)
2. newton's third law doesn't prevent electric propulsion from reaching orbit. inventing lighter batteries and motors doesn't break newton's third law
3. newton's third law could prevent space flight if it wasn't for xenon engines. since they exist, it doesn't

All the concept refers to is the fact that ejecting mass from a container requires a force, which by Newton's 3rd means said mass pushes with equal force against its container. For example in combustion rockets (aka the things we do use as launch vehicles), we burn fuel, this causes a massive increase in its volume, as anyone who has taken high school physics ought to be aware increase in volume or temperature of a gas in a bound container increases pressure, we direct the release of gas downward and thus Newton's 3rd says the container goes up.

symonx99,"No, it's a sensible question don't worry.
There are two different answers:

In interstellar space, that is far from gravitational sources, it's true that even with an infinitesimal initial push you would continue travelling, and indeed space probes in interplanetary space don't usually use fuel, unless they are correcting their trajectories.

But what you get is a constant velocity and if your push is small, the speed won't be great either.
So you need an accelarating phase to arrive to a satisfying speed, and this is the phase where you need the expell backwards some kind of fuel.

Then there's another point, if the probe, satellite whatever, starts from earth or another big source of gravity you can't simply give an initial push and be done, because the mass below you is constantly trying you pull you down, so you need to continuously fight the down pointing force with an upward one, given by the expulsion of fuel, that fittingly is generally referred to as propellant.",2023-01-08 17:53:39,j3hrqqz,t1_j3hoc7f,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hrqqz/,4,Positive

It doesn't help Elon that he gave as little context as possible though. Saying ""No, lol, newton's 3rd law"" is so vague as to enable anybody to interpret it as right or wrong. Elons groupies are gonna say ""duh, that's how all change in momentum works"", and Elons criticizers are gonna say ""BUT-BUT ION ENGINES!!1"", and *they're both technically right when all context is removed*.

But in the context of space travel, you have to bring your own mass to push against, even for ion engines, and when that propellant runs out the engine is dead, which for all intents and purposes makes it a propellant driven engine, not an electric driven engine. An internal combustion engine is not electric simply because electricity kicks off the reaction the same way an ion engine is not electric because the momentum comes from electricity. Both are defined by the finite resource that are required for their operation.

But Elon refusing to elaborate makes him look like an idiot because there are ways to electrically give momentum to a propellant.

phred14,"I made some sort of comment about the ""Elon distraction team"" on the other social media platform, and a ""SpaceX employee"" responded with a bunch of ""Team Musk"" statements about how brilliant the guy is and how he's responsible for all of the good stuff happening there.

So we have two opinions, diametrically opposing.

Ignoring the southeast Asia cave thing for a moment, I can think of a few highly visible things that appear to be Musk decisions...

Technology decisions for self-driving at Tesla - don't look good, so far.

Firing the Raptor guy and replacing him - jury is out, but looks good.

SpaceX rapid prototyping philosophy - don't know how much is Musk and how much was just the company.  But it seems that they've slowed down since he got ""distracted"" by twitter.  However they seem to still be on a path, though much less public.  Things were also getting big enough with Super Heavy that rapid prototyping failures were going to start getting really costly.

Wasting_Time272,Dude chill out a bit. I actually like Elon. That doesn’t mean that I think everything he says is perfect. I believe Twitter in general has the problem of being a platform that is rarely capable of nuanced discussion and that Elon tweet was a good example of how the one short statement “get dunked on” mentality of Twitter is an issue. Elon has done more for aerospace and for EVs that anyone in the recent past. He is a maverick in more ways than one and I think we are all better off to have him around even if he can be a bit wacky sometimes. That does not mean I like everything he says and even if I did like everything he said that doesn’t mean I would agree with all his actions.

TheRealStepBot,"This version of what an electric rocket is so very misaligned with the common conception of a rocket as to not be one. The original question obviously is completely context free and as such it is just as valid to read any fucking thing you want into the question.

The most reasonable interpretation of the question is basically something like “can you just slap a bunch of teslas together into a rocket machine in some magic configuration that doesn’t produce any emissions”

His answer is an answer to that question and a valid one.

Your contrived and pedantic focus on the mass flow of charged particles within and wait for this bit of genius, a closed electrical circuit which has a net reaction of zero, is not only likely wrong on the mere basis of physics but also completely besides the point.

It is clearly driven by some absurd desire to dunk on Elon. Dunking on the dude won’t fucking change even one detail of your shitty life mate.

Purely electrical rockets are not currently understood to be possible as current flow is not a free lunch. It’s always a closed circuit with net zero mass flow ie no reaction and thus no thrust.

robertojh_200,"There is so much superfluous smoke screen shit here. The topic is about rockets; not about electric motors operating cars, drones or factories, not about mechanical aerodynamic systems, it’s about rockets, it’s about thrust and the mechanics therein.  Thrust is dictated by Newton’s third law as propellant is expelled out one end and this expulsion creates an equal and opposite force against the rocket to push it. That’s Newton’s third law. That is the law that governs the foundation of rocketry. 

Electric ion engines, such as Xenon engines, expel propellant ionized gases, like xenon, by accelerating them backward out the craft with electric fields. This is a very slow level of acceleration for the craft, but it’s a constant acceleration over a much longer period of time and so is utilized in light weight deep space sats and orbital LEO sats to maintain orbit (like Elon’s own Starlink). It does not generate enough force to push against a heavy space craft in a gravity well to overcome the weight of the vehicle in that gravity well, per Newton’s third law; the equal and opposite reaction of the thrust is less than the equal and opposite reaction of the ship pushing against the earth. Ergo, you cannot create a xenon or any other electric rocket because it lacks the thrust—the force—to achieve forward movement. You can only utilize them as thrusters in a zero g vacuum, but not as a rocket launch system. 

I don’t know what in the hell electric drones or factories have to do with propulsion, thrust, and specific impulse.",2023-01-08 18:11:01,j3hujf2,t1_j3hru4r,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hujf2/,1,Positive

The mass of the rocket still has to be accelerated f=ma is still applied while not in gravity because it's totally independent of gravity. Very little force from the ion drive with a lot og mass will create very little acceleration always. It 100% will get you there but it won't be as fast as something with a lot of thrust. You need to accelerate on the way to your destination and then decelerate far before you reach it to match the velocity. I don't know what you're talking about with this OMS I'll probably Google later but iirc ion thrust is not usually in the range of kilonewtons but a few newtons which is why it's used to propel satellites and probes which are light and not super dependent on the time to get someplace because there aren't people on em and they've already broken earth's gravity.

Sure ion engines exist as a means of electrically powered propulsion, but they are hardly rockets and the secondary propellant means they at best stretch the definition of electric engine.

But he says so little that he basically starts an argument without finishing it, so you're either frustrated that he essentially is saying ""water is wet"" while not explicitly stating what the actual fuck it has to do with the reasons why, or you're making his argument for him (hardly something someone who ***claims*** to be that smart needs).

bassman314,"I believe this is correct.  The only reason we do not have Ion or other non-combustion rocket motors that are able to escape planetary gravity is less about absolute laws of physics, and more about our ability to see the nuance in those laws, and to develop/discover technology that allows us to take advantage of those nuances.  

Example: Barely 200 years ago, we assumed that the physical laws would stop humans from achieving flight.  We discovered that some gasses are lighter than others and developed technology that allowed balloons to float using either a lighter elemental gas (Hydrogen, Helium), or heated atmospheric gasses in a bladder that made that gas locally lighter than the air outside of the bladder.  

A bit over a hundred years ago, we assumed the laws of physics barred us from fast overland flight, and that the best we could do was slow and lumbering.  The Wright Brothers changed that.  

I know I am an optimist, but I look back thousands of years and see what humanity was able to develop with what they had, this just seems like another problem that has a solution we just haven't gotten to yet.  I'm not saying it'll be a year, or even a hundred years, but I am convinced that we will achieve FTL travel and the ability to launch from ground to orbit without relying on strapping ourselves to tin can that is regulating a controlled explosion.",2023-01-09 17:57:18,j3mw9i9,t1_j3gmdf1,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3mw9i9/,1,Positive

In 1969 she was a finalist in the Miss South Africa beauty competition, and one year after that married Elon Musk’s father, Errol Musk. In the mid-1980s, the family profited handsomely from Errol Musk’s purchasing of an emerald mine, after selling their airplane for £80,000 (the equivalent of £320,000 today).

&#x200B;

“We went to this guy’s prefab and he opened his safe and there was just stacks of money and he paid me out, £80,000, it was a huge amount of money,” Errol Musk said, according to Business Insider. Errol Musk was then made another offer: to spend £40,000 on an emerald mine. “I said, ‘Oh, all right’. So I became a half owner of the mine, and we got emeralds for the next six years,” Errol Musk said.

&#x200B;

As a result of this, the teenage Elon Musk once walked the streets of New York with emeralds in his pocket. His father said: “We were very wealthy. We had so much money at times we couldn’t even close our safe,” adding that one person would have to hold the money in place with another closing the door. “And then there’d still be all these notes sticking out and we’d sort of pull them out and put them in our pockets.”",2023-01-08 18:35:18,j3hykrk,t1_j3hfu9e,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hykrk/,1,Positive

mrthenarwhal,"You could, but that’s hardly an electric rocket. If you had to fill your electric car with some kind of “propellant” and use a motor to throw it out the back, you probably wouldn’t call it an electric car anymore. At that point, the “fuel” would be the propellant as much as it would be the electricity which powers the pump that throws it out the back, so that would make it some kind of hybrid engine that doesn’t exist, not electric. 

Also, slightly related, an electric rocket is not currently feasible because of the energy storage math. Batteries can’t even store enough energy to power the pumps that fuel the combustion engines on rockets, much less store enough power to reach any appreciable altitude by any method. The notable exception being rocket lab’s electron which is small enough to use battery powered pumps. You currently can’t beat hydrocarbons in terms of energy density, and it’s going to take orders of magnitude of battery tech improvements or some futuristic nuclear rocket science to change that fact.",2023-01-08 19:18:10,j3i5nuy,t1_j3i0h11,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3i5nuy/,8,Positive

AuraMaster7,"Hi, aerospace engineer here. The thrust of a rocket is determined by the mass flow rate and velocity of the exhaust propellant as well as the pressure difference between the exhaust and the surrounding atmosphere (or lack thereof) multiplied by the area of the exhaust nozzle. 

The only pressure difference taken into account is that between the exhaust nozzle and the free stream. The pressure on the rest of the rocket does not determine the thrust of the rocket, nor is it what generates the force.

And for that exhaust/free stream pressure differential, did you think that pressure difference was just created automatically out of thin air?

your idea about electric motor force -----------> factory example to explain it's irrelevant

OKura94,"I feel I better understand your argument here, but it still appears flawed.

firstly, I agree that industry is very specific about the terminology used, outside of public outreach, but point taken.

Let's then look at the limiting factor(s) on the thrust generated by ion drives (our most well known form of EPS). You are absolutely correct that the accelerated mass is significantly smaller than in chemical rockets, though typically in terms of the mols (number of molecules) ejected than the mass of said molecule. (meaning larger propellants are typically used, but a system could be designed to use more at once)

F=ma the force equation we all learn in school, as mass (m) goes down linearly F does as well.

but in using a smaller mass of propellant we can increase its velocity significantly higher with the same amount of energy (by virtue of it having lower inertia). If we decompose the same force formula to base units we get

N=kg\*(m/s\^2) (F replaced with newtons and mass with kilograms for sake of clarity and not having m defined twice)

We see here that force scales exponentially with linear increase in velocity (recall that m/s is scalar speed, which is being squared), this means that as long as the right velocity can be achieved in the propellant not only can we potentially make up for the loss in force (aka thrust) introduced by the decreased mass, we can potentially exceed it.

There are two limiting factors here though, we cannot accelerate the propellant to the speed of light, and the amount of energy required to accelerate the propellant also grows with the target speed.

There's nothing in the 3rd law that says we can't have ion drives or other EPS with escape level thrust, it's a matter of energy availability and cost. We use chemical rockets to get into space because it's cheaper, not because the other options break physics.",2023-01-08 22:20:07,j3izpc0,t1_j3iwfjy,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3izpc0/,0,Positive
TommyTuttle,"A rocket is a specific type of engine; by definition it does not *require* combustion but it does require some type of physical propellant flying out the back. Propellant functions as the mass that the rocket pushes against, to propel itself. That’s why rockets work in space, where helicopters don’t. 

An electric launch vehicle, sure, that’s perfectly possible. There is plenty of air for any type of engine to push against. I like the dream of mag-lev and if it ever works it’ll also revolutionize plain old air travel. Which is a very good thing imho. 

There currently is no means of propulsion in space that isn’t a rocket of some kind.

symonx99,"A full electric engine wouldn't provider any kind of propulsion because there aren't any particles to launch backwards.
Well you could use the electrons of the current but they would give a minimal propulsion and are quite hard to pull out of the engine without putting something along their trajectory that would stop most of time.
So in this very strict sense Musk is right, but i'd say that's a really strict interpretation.

An electric car doesn't get any propulsion from the engine, neither a fuel car to tell the truth, the propulsion comes from the rotation of the wheels against the soil which is enabled by the engine.

So maybe we could call a ion thruster engine powered by electricity an electrically propelled rocket?

Though curious if you could have a long enough stretch to allow for gradual acceleration up to that point and how much extra electricity it would use to move gradually vs. fast as possible. Either way would probably be the largest bank of capacitors in existence to railgun something into space.

Even if you were able to achieve nuclear photonic propulsion there's a question of 'is it a rocket' since it doesn't use combustion of fuel to propel itself. It's nuclear fission to achieve photonic thrust.

I think there is no such thing as an electric rocket because rockets by definition use combustion. Like asking for an electric engine. You can potentially power a car, lawnmower or other item with electricity, but it won't have an engine. It'll have a motor.

Can we theoretically power long-range flying tube things with electricity? Maybe in the future. But they wouldn't meet the current definition of a rocket.

DM_DM_DND,"I mean, he is different from the rest of those people-his initial opportunities involved his father giving him money from his emerald mine. He then invested in a grey area of law that basically let him operate pay pal as a bank while doing things you simply aren't allowed to do as a bank, allowing him to stretch risk portfolios and avoid regulations. Basically, he did shady shit too.

Of course, Musk has since denied that this is a significant part of his wealth, but the money trail and business model is clear.

To clarify-his first deal used his father's funds to setup his stake, which later become 22 million. There is some indication is that Musk really did earn that money through work and effort, and the only shady part is the initial capital, which Elon is hardly *personally* culpable for even if it benefits him. It's his later dealings after he already had enough wealth to quietly walk away from business that are shady, specifically with how Paypal operated/operates. 

The other aspect of his wealth is navigating American culture. We fetishize businessmen and have a dirty love affair with privatization of public services-if you can make an even *slightly* believable claim to do something the government does but better it's immediately going to be taken as gospel truth. It can be the most obvious damnable lie ever uttered, but it's the right lie for us.

Hence SpaceX, which primarily does the same things that any competent space agency does in terms of launching and testing, is the darling of the political eye. They get contracts simply because they aren't government run or an established company. Similarly, Tesla could release unusable cars and still receive positive media coverage simply because it's a private company ""doings something about global warming"".

This isn't to say that Musk deserves *no* credit for his successes, but he deserves zero *goodwill*. His entire business model is basically centered around skirting regulation while receiving lucrative deals from the government. If he accepted that and simply took the money he'd be able to live in some mansion and raise the next Hilton family. But his narcissism and corruption got the best of him, he started stepping over some severe lines, and now he's running to the far-right for validation and immunity to prosecution.

I liked Zubrin's optimistic outlook on the space industry and he's spot on about several things. As someone in this industry specialized in microwave and RF engineering, I don't believe that orbital solar farms for terrestrial power generation is actually a good idea. It's possible, but the energy cost of orbiting the infrastructure would be more than improvement in solar availability would yield over it's usable life when compared to a terrestrial deployment of the same equipment. Because he was kind of arguing for that, or at least talking about orbital solar generation stations as the future, there were some aspects of the book I didn't quite agree on.

L0renzoVonMatterhorn,"Funny enough, I *do* know. 

It’s not the “motor” that’s the problem. We can propel particles as fast as we want. We can also pump as much gas as we want into a chamber.

Soul_of_Jacobeh,"Although not definitive, it is most likely that it would've been referred to as a ""thruster"" for those cases. Before you say it, yes, thrusters are technically rockets. Low power ones targeted at keeping an orbit, attitude control, or long-duration low-thrust acceleration (the cases you brought up).

For use in atmosphere, we do have electric thrusters that ionize the surrounding air. In a perfect world, Elon would've brought up these in-atmosphere electric thrusters, and clarified his blanket-statement for the rest of the rocket types.

So it comes down to the level of pedanticism we're willing to go to for the conversation, whether we'll consider thrusters to be a part of what World of Engineering was asking, what Elon was considering in his concise ^(*to put it kindly*) reply, and what we're discussing in this thread.  

The aerospace engineer (rocket scientist, anyone?) is likely the most qualified to set the precedent for how precise we'll be in our conversation. They lightly touched on high-efficiency/low-thrust thrusters, and then immediately moved on to high thrust systems.  

So I guess to answer your original question, the closest thing this thread has to a rocket scientist said something about achieving escape velocity.",2023-01-08 17:01:15,j3hjgit,t1_j3hg3an,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hjgit/,1,Positive

NoXion604,"> You could, but that’s hardly an electric rocket. If you had to fill your electric car with some kind of “propellant” and use a motor to throw it out the back, you probably wouldn’t call it an electric car anymore. At that point, the “fuel” would be the propellant as much as it would be the electricity which powers the pump that throws it out the back, so that would make it some kind of hybrid engine that doesn’t exist, not electric.

No, that would still be an electric car, just one that applies its power really inefficiently, rather than just turning the wheels. The energy driving it forward would still be coming from an electric battery, would it not?

Also, you can't really compare cars and rockets like that, because cars are subject to friction and must continuously fight it in order to keep moving. Whereas a rocket vehicle applies thrust in order to change its acceleration, it doesn't have a ""range"" like a ground vehicle does.

> Also, slightly related, an electric rocket is not currently feasible because of the energy storage math. Batteries can’t even store enough energy to power the pumps that fuel the combustion engines on rockets, much less store enough power to reach any appreciable altitude by any method.

Being able to lift a spacecraft off from the Earth's surface is not a defining characteristic of a rocket engine. Electric rockets already exist, they're called [ion thrusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster) and have been used in satellites for a while now.

> The notable exception being rocket lab’s electron which is small enough to use battery powered pumps. You currently can’t beat hydrocarbons in terms of energy density, and it’s going to take orders of magnitude of battery tech improvements or some futuristic nuclear rocket science to change that fact.

Or you could leave the bulky power generator behind and [beam the energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam-powered_propulsion) to the spacecraft.

First of all Elon seems to be talking about rockets as a spacecraft and not rocket engines or rocket stages. That kind of makes this whole conversation a little off topic from the original question.

Hall Effect thrusters use electricity to propel a propellant, so while they do use electricity they aren't all electric and still need some sort of propellant.

Robert_The_Red,"Effectively speaking the equivalent to an electric car's propulsion would be a massive rail gun that acted as a mass driver to orbit. I think this could potentially be viable but I don't think that would fit the concept of a rocket per se. At that point it's more of an advanced bullet or artillery shell. Ideally sticking to the concept of electric power you could install an ion drive to the payload to reach a desired orbit location gradually once up.

IAmBecomeBorg,"There’s the academic definition of rocket engines that aerospace engineers learn (to distinguish from turbojet or turbofan engines, or turboprop, ramjet, scramjet, etc.) but the colloquial understanding is different. When someone says “electric rocket”, people imagine a rocket that blasts off from the ground and goes into space. Which Hall thrusters cannot do. That is not possible with any electric technology we currently know of, except maybe a hypothetical massive rail gun that slingshots a vehicle into orbit. But that would literally not be a rocket. 

Nobody hearing “electric rocket” imagines a thruster capable of millinewtons of force slightly  altering the orbital trajectory of a satellite already in orbit. 

Also aerospace engineers do not use the term “electric rocket” because that is not a term. We use the term “electric propulsion”:

All_Work_All_Play,"I mean I haven't done the calculations but the real answer would likely be to some wavelength that isn't readily absorbed by current atmosphere but can be easily absorbed (or deflected out to space) on a less harmless fashion. 

Actually the more you think about it the more amusing some setups become. Consider using microwaves for the initial lift off, terrible idea right? Well not if you launch from the middle of a man made water reservoir that was built specifically to absorb all the energy required to launch. 

This is actually a fun little math problem. If we magically had lossless thrust closed loop (we don't!), it still takes ~30MJ to move 1kg of mass from the Earth's surface to low orbit. Which means getting 1 kg to space would take 30,000,000 j / 4180 J /kg °C, or roughly 7160kgs of water one degree Celsius which is roughly 2000 gallons of water one degree. So if we wanted to get the falcon 9 into low earth orbit, that's 550,000 kg worth of mass. If we're okay with a 10° differential, we'd need 200 * 550,000 = 110 millions gallons of water which is roughly 170 Olympic sized swimming pools worth of water. 

Actually that amount of water is fairly trivial. The real question would be if the water would transfer the heat quick enough not to flash boil. Lifting off slower takes more energy (which we've conveniently hand waved away here), so there'd probably be some ideal wavelength that would penetrate further into the water and spread out the energy absorption. 

What a curious idea.",2023-01-08 17:24:39,j3hn5xt,t1_j3hiulv,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hn5xt/,7,Positive

robertojh_200,"The third law is the problem though, because the third law is what governs rocketry. Propellant is expelled out the back of the rocket to create an equal and opposite force that pushes on the rocket; as propellant flies out the back, force is delivered in both directions. But if that propellant doesn’t have enough equal and opposite force to provide upwards thrust against the downward force of gravity, and the rocket pushing against the earth (IE its force weight), then that form of propulsion simply won’t work for a rocket. 

What he’s basically saying here, in a facetious kind of way, is that anybody with a basic understanding of the third law of motion (or rather, a basic understanding of rocketry) would know that electric rockets can’t work because ion engines don’t generate enough equal and opposite force. I understand you don’t like the guy, apparently nobody in this thread likes him, but that doesn’t change that what he said is correct.

AuraMaster7,"That's a fair point about requiring a fuel other than electricity.

I guess it really just comes down to the details of how you want to define an electric rocket.

I'm of the mindset that a rocket will always require a propellant. If it doesn't have a propellant it isn't really a rocket. And so an electric rocket would still have a propellant but the method of using said propellant would be electricity. 

It's like if you look at an electric propeller plane. It technically uses electricity to drive a propeller that accelerates a propellant (air). An ion thruster is the same way, but because a rocket needs to be a closed system and able to operate in a vacuum, it must carry its own propellant.",2023-01-08 11:36:14,j3ghc2v,t1_j3gh1un,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3ghc2v/,24,Positive

TerrariaGaming004,"Let’s say you want to send 50 kilos of whatever into the iss for a restock. The iss moved at 4.76 miles per second, 7660 meters per second in the x direction, where y us straight up and x is tangent to the iss orbit. To get the package up to 408000 meters to the iss, you can find with a little bit of math that it would need to be going 8 million meters per second to be launched like a projectile straight up.

Since adding these two speeds makes it move at an angle, it’s no longer in line with the orbit, so instead I’ll just give the spin launch the benefit of letting the iss move past a 50kg box at 4 miles per second and somehow catch it. 

So, all we need to do is throw the box into the air at 8 million meters per second. The internet says the radius of the throwing arm is 50 meters, so to get the edge of that 50m circle spinning at 8 million meters per second, you would have to have the circle spinning at 160239 radians per second, or 1.5 million rpm. If there is literally zero mass on the swinging arm and it’s just the 50kg package, there would require a second 50kg mass opposite the package to stop it from shaking. Except of course as soon as you release the package the machine would start vibrating out of control and probably explode. 

The energy required to just get the one mass to that speed, not even the other one required to stabilize it, 1.6 * 10^15 joules of energy. That’s the amount of energy in 50 million liters of gasoline. If this could even possibly ever happen without friction losses, after launching the package of food, which btw would burn almost immediately in the air, you now have another now unstable spinning mass with more energy than the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.

A projectile will never reach the iss, ever. The only reason rockets can go up there is because they just push a little harder than gravity for the entire time they get into orbit. A projectile can’t push onto anything ever, so it has to have all of its energy immediately.

If you think we could even get something spinning that fast, don’t forget that I didn’t calculate how fast it would need to go with air resistance. And in case you don’t know, air resistance force increases with the square of velocity",2023-01-08 16:39:15,j3hg1xy,t1_j3hbpxq,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3hg1xy/,3,Positive

Not_Oscar_Muffin,"Nobody said the electrical power had the be part of the payload.

I can take a vessel full of water and superheat it using an external electrical source. I can then disconnect that external source and open a valve on my vessel. This will allow the water to expand and turn into steam, providing thrust.

There's no combusion involved in my emmisions, only a phase change. The only power I've used is electrical.

This is cheaper, safer, easier to construct and more reliable than combustion rockets. Which is why it sees a fair amount of use.

There are also proposals that state that this may be used for interplanetary travel due to the ease of electricity generation in space and supposed ease of acquiring propellant (water ice) from various celestial bodies.

DefinitelyNotAliens,"Theoretically, we could have a giant slingshot railgun to launch non-manned spacecraft into HALO orbit, which would be electric launch, but not a rocket.

Also, pedantically, rockets use combustion by definition. The slingshot railgun satellites would be projectiles and not rocket powered.

Theoretically, non-combustion means of propulsion exist. A theoretical nuclear fission device could use photonic thrust to achieve movement, too.

None of these methods actually exist, of course. All questionably 'rockets' and questionably an answer to 'electric' spacecraft or low-orbit launch methods.

There's also non-combustion methods currently used in space. Solar sails, for instance. Again, though, it is not a rocket. Does propel items through space.

There's also the fact the majority of fuel use is in low altitude so if you have a rail system at lower speeds that accelerates them through the troposphere and is a space elevator that launches up, up, up and then launches human-manned spacecraft and then they use a quarter the fuel because we're launching them from 30,000+ feet off our rollercoaster into oblivion... partially electric for the ride up and first bit of the launch.

NoXion604,"> You seem comfortable throwing out the generally accepted definition of an electric vehicle, which is commonly one that only needs electric power to move.

How am I doing that, exactly? This hypothetical vehicle we are discussing would still use energy from an electric battery, would it not? Thus being electrically powered. It would still travel along the ground would it not? Thus it would still be a car.

So it would still be an electric car. Just one that uses a convoluted and inefficient way of turning stored battery power into motion.

> Rockets need propellant, and since I don’t believe in the EM drive nonsense, and nobody has a good way to turn energy into matter yet, you have to bring propellant, argon or krypton or whatever. If you’re ok with calling a vehicle that needs electricity and propellant an electric vehicle, then that’s fine I guess, but I wouldn’t personally. As you said, they’re called ion thrusters. Bring Your Own Ions

TheRealStepBot,"That’s exactly why Elon is right and all the people in here who took a physics class once are wrong. 

In space you are missing that, all so important, friction bit that allows you to use earth as you reaction mass. From the perspective of a bounding box drawn around the car there is no reaction mass in an electric car.

The reason rockets are massive and yet still absolutely completely hopelessly underpowered is because they have to lug all that reaction mass with them in their fuel tanks.

Changing it to some sort of electric power source (nuclear, solar etc) still requires you to lug around roughly the same amount of reaction mass with the added penalty that unlike in chemical rockets the mass is inert which requires you to carry the mass penalty of the power source with you. This makes them even weaker than chemical rockets so they can’t be used inside significant gravity wells.

No matter how you draw the bounding box there is no reasonable version of a bounding box that doesn’t include carrying your reaction mass with you which means such rockets share most of the problems of regular chemical rockets.

A purely electric rocket can only exist theoretically by some as of yet undiscovered exotic process that allows the direct conversion of energy into momentum.",2023-01-08 12:22:05,j3gl16b,t1_j3gaifj,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3gl16b/,3,Positive

astro_osrs,"I understood it as, since earth will be placing gravity, a force, onto the rocket, then to escape earth it must accelerate with a greater force than gravity so that it can propel itself into outer space and escape. And that the force or acceleration of a completely electric rocket wouldn't equal the amount needed to escape earths gravity with our current technology. I feel like there's definitely a few ways it makes sense in terms of the third law. Like I said, he could have done a better job of explaining it, but afaik, third law is pretty important when it comes to rockets. Maybe we don't have the tech right now, but it was a broad question answered very broadly. I wouldn't buy into the fact that uttering newton's third law makes someone a genius, I think that's a really specific way to interpret this tweet. More so he answered a boring, broad question with a boring, broad answer. The true answer to that question would probably be a few pages in length, at the VERY least.

elsuakned,">The true answer to that question would probably be a few pages in length, at the VERY least.

No, I have three different examples of where it could be a single sentence. This is like if you asked me if zero has a sign, as in is it positive or negative, and I just said ""lol no because math"". I could just say no. I could say 'no, if it had a sign, there would be contradictions when you try to multiply'. I could actually show one of the simple proofs if I really want to, or point to someone who did. Or even just say that there is an actual proof and let that give the person I'm talking to a little bit of direction for their own endeavor. Instead, I sound more like a condescending prick that doesn't actually know why than if I had just not answered at all. Luckily for me, that's a simple topic that people aren't super interested in and aren't coming to me to learn more about, so maybe I'd get away with that. 

But it's not a good answer for a CEO to give when someone is asking about what they do, and it's a little suspicious to me that the guy who is not at all a rocket scientist but pretends that he is is giving that type of answer. I've seen a lot of examples of heads of companies talking about industry on twitter or things like that and they pretty much always, you know, actually engage meaningfully. The guy who tweeted him isn't asking if there's actually currently electric rockets he hasn't heard of before. At the very least talking about *how much* weaker they are, or why they are weaker, or why the current model is better, or if they could potentially get better with time, anything like that, it doesn't need to be specific, just a sentence, gives the reader an idea of the mindset behind the answer or the actual science that went into it. His answer, according to your interpretation, is essentially ""no, they aren't strong enough""- that's damn near insulting to the guy askings intelligence lol. WE KNOW. You don't think if electric rockets that *were* strong enough to get to space existed we would have heard about them? How far away are okes that aren't? Does he think it'll ever happen? Why not? Is there something about the tech that actually directly ties to newton's laws that is specific to electric engines or something? We don't know, ne cause he literally said nothing. 

>I understood it as, since earth will be placing gravity, a force, onto the rocket, then to escape earth it must accelerate with a greater force than gravity so that it can propel itself into outer space and escape.

 Which doesn't really have much to do with N3L honestly, unless you didn't know that the rocket flies in the opposite direction of where the fire blows out. The difference between the rockets we have and the idea of the electric rocket isn't that one would follow N3L and the other wouldn't. The fact that one generates enough thrust and the other doesn't is pretty much independent of the idea that whatever is generated will create an equal and opposite reaction...

One thing that bothers me about Teslas is precisely that, but the fact that it goes fast, goes far and has nifty tech with makes up for it. 

In finance terms, a company is largely valued by what it is expected to earn along time. Even though Tesla stock could still be considered absurdly priced in relation to current operations, there is still strong confidence about it's future, its unique value proposition and its position as market leader, which accounts for its bad build quality.

TheHolyJamsheed302,"You can only push off the ground while you are in contact with the ground, Newton’s third law mandates this. This means that either you have to have a ridiculously large project, I’m talking a cannon a couple miles long into the sky, or you have to deal with a ridiculously large amount of G force. It took the US years to make electronics that could withstand being shot out of artillery cannons, it was ridiculously inefficient, large, and unwieldy, and that was at a couple hundred Gs, a suborbital trajectory would place a couple thousand if not more. ADDITIONALLY, as if that’s not good enough, any launch from atmosphere will always result in a suborbital trajectory, not an orbital one. If you launch something into orbit it will always come back to the point where it was accelerated. This means that launching something into space with a cannon would have it fly back around the world and smack into its launch point, and to avoid this, the projectile would need to have a rocket of its own and burn in space to raise its periapsis above the atmosphere. At that point just make a multi stage rocket and launch infinitely more capable and complex payloads than a cannon could launch

The theory is viable. It is just incredibly unwieldy and there is a much easier way. Dont trust redditors, 99% of the people on this thread are full of shit

Things happen one step at a time and till we reach the step that makes it viable it is waste of effort for every one to just sit and wait for it to happen.,2023-01-09 01:41:17,j3jtzyy,t1_j3jt9v0,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3jtzyy/,1,Negative
musci1223,My last time responding to you because I getting tired of it. I hate Elon but just because I don't like him doesn't mean he is wrong in every fucking case. Electric rockets are not possible right now. They will be possible in future. There are systems that can do stuff similar to rockets but they cannot do the job rockets are doing right now. There is a reason there are no rockets being launched using no traditional fuel even in poc phase.,2023-01-09 02:14:58,j3jyt9t,t1_j3jyc0e,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/106ah0w/behold_my_friends_the_brightest_mind_to_ever/j3jyt9t/,1,Negative
