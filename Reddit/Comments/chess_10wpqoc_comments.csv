IngenuityCrazy1642,See I disagree with this a bit. Doing puzzles has objectively helped me gain a better intuition for when there is a tactic available such as knight forks. I used to lose games constantly to knight forks but when I started doing more puzzles I would recognize some of the tactics. My daily and long form games started getting better. I don’t think they are helpful with any time control under 10 minutes bc those games are as much about avoiding unnecessary material losses vs solid foundational chess.
