ralpes,"Taxes you mentioned are on income, the billionaires are gaining from renting, capital gain, stock growth or dividends. No one gets rich working.

Are there loopholes? Probably. I am not aware of them, let me know if you find something legal!

**Edit**: to clarify the 45% are income tax. Landlord are taxable on the gains of rent through income tax, if they lease as private person. I had few landlords in the past that had their property in a company and leased from there. I assume this is for taxes. 

Dividend, interests and other capital gains are taxed at 25% … 
Stock growth is only taxed when the stocks get sold. 

I should clarify better that typical billionaire earnings are getting taxed too, but different than labor. Well and income tax is progressing, lower income pay less than 45%. Less than 9.7k no tax, above 14% and as the income gets more the tax level grows. The 45% you mentioned are taxed on income of 275k and higher.",2023-01-14 07:07:52,j4ab9pn,t3_10bi4zs,/r/germany/comments/10bi4zs/how_are_there_so_many_millionaires_and/j4ab9pn/,1068,Positive
GreenAppleLady,"Well, how many are there?

SeniorePlatypus,"There‘s a few topics around that.

First of all, 50% of wealth in Germany is inherited. Our inheritance tax is absurdly low. Effectively between 2% for people with double digit millions and 0.2% for people with tripple digit millions. This is not exclusive to Germany but it‘s a big problem here. You don‘t get rich through work. You get rich by inheriting lots of money and then having it grow in some way from the labor and money of others. 

Which is point number two. 45% taxes do not include deductibles and most wealth doesn‘t exist as cash. It never even turned into cash at any point in time. Wealth doesn‘t accumulate as a result of income at all and if you focus on income you‘re unlikely to become rich.

For example, if you run a company, you don‘t pay income taxes on the value and profits of that company. Me owning two houses falls under income tax. If a rich person buys 300 houses they can found a company, buy the houses through the company and pay only 20% of taxes on profits. But you don‘t even have to pay that if you keep buying more real estate. Since you only pay taxes on profits. You can see the snowballing effect such structures have.

And despite the money being tied up in these companies or foundations it is accessible as one can take out loans against the company itself. Loans with next to zero interest rate since they are backed so heavily. Meaning they rarely have to touch the assets in such a way that they have to pay taxes. Let alone income tax. 

Rich people don‘t pay income tax. You don‘t become rich from income.",2023-01-14 10:26:59,j4aq18c,t3_10bi4zs,/r/germany/comments/10bi4zs/how_are_there_so_many_millionaires_and/j4aq18c/,104,Positive

rewboss,"First off, it's a myth that paying high taxes means that people will be poor. Another thing you'll notice about Germany is that while poverty and even homelessness do exist (because people do slip through the net, unfortunately), it's not quite on the scale as it is in parts of, for example, the US, where even people in paid middle-class jobs can end up sleeping in their car. We don't have a massive underclass of people trying to work two full-time jobs and a side-hustle just to pay their bills.

This is because tax revenue doesn't get thrown into a black hole to be taken out of the space/time continuum. Sure, there are many examples of taxpayers' money being wasted, but mostly it's put to work in ways that benefit us all. Mandatory health insurance? Yeah, but then you'll never go bankrupt trying to pay for your child's chemotherapy. Social security contributions automatically docked from your pay? Sure, but if your employer goes out of business and you're suddenly without a job, that state will make sure you won't starve before you can find a new job.

This because we have a social market economy, also known as ""Rhine capitalism"". It's a capitalist market economy, but regulated to make it fair -- and Elon Musk is about to learn that German workers, unions, courts, regulatory authorities and politicians all don't like it when billionaires try to make themselves even richer than they already are by taking away employees' rights and paying them peanuts.

That's the first thing. The second thing is that the 45% figure is the top rate for income tax, which is payable on wages and salaries. But it's not payable on capital gains, which is where the very rich make their money. There are now calls to tax capital gains properly, because the principle of ""from each according to ability to each according to need"" is generally seen as a pretty good policy.",2023-01-14 07:42:32,j4adz0d,t3_10bi4zs,/r/germany/comments/10bi4zs/how_are_there_so_many_millionaires_and/j4adz0d/,400,Positive

711friedchicken,"If you make 5 million a year but have to pay half that in taxes, you’re still a millionaire. That and there are quite a few loopholes to reduce the actual tax rate you pay in the end. I’d say most very rich people who don’t go to extreme lengths of ""tax optimization"" effectively pay about 15-30% taxes on their income. (Total speculation here btw, impossible to say for sure and it varies a lot. Some people get down to almost 0% if they put in the effort, but if you’re doing that you’re almost certainly hitting at least a legal grey area.)

When I say ""very rich"", I mean people with a yearly income of >300k or so. Lower than that, a lot of the more intricate tax optimization strategies yield diminishing returns. I know quite a few people who make 100-200k a year and they all pay their income taxes according to plan. But above that, there’s a lot more room for creativity because even a small reduction in your tax rate percentage-wise can mean lots of more money left over.

Also, keep in mind that *whenever* you read the net worth of a rich person, it includes the value of their own company which they own. But that doesn’t mean they really ""have"" that money. If you own a large-but-still normal house in a good location, maybe one that you inherited from your family, you’re probably a millionaire too. But that money isn’t readily available your recurring income might be very normal, so you’re not paying taxes on the ""millions"" that you own. It’s the same with companies. Big time company owners and CEOs might pay themselves a few 100k a year and pay their income taxes on that, but on paper they are billionaires. Most of the millionaire/billionaire lifestyle, like flying a private jet, is usually just made a company expense, so they can basically spend more money than they personally have in liquid funds.",2023-01-14 09:27:23,j4alp21,t3_10bi4zs,/r/germany/comments/10bi4zs/how_are_there_so_many_millionaires_and/j4alp21/,7,Positive
chopchoppopadop,"Finance girl chiming in. As many comments have said, rich people don’t get rich working, although in some cases you can. Rich people keep their money in assets like property, business, stocks, hedge funds and so on. Usually they get smart people to set up business entities for them, and if you have a good tax accountant, you can legally move assets around to minimize tax and financial risk. There are other options like moving money offshore, investing in foreign businesses and so on. So basically: really rich people don’t sleep on their money. That is the main difference between having a well paid job- shove everything into a sad savings account with 0,1% interest. No-one is getting rich like that. In one year your money will be worth less. You need to make your money work for you buy investing in assets that will generate additional income streams. “Normal” people fall into the routine of creating liabilities or plainly expensing all/most of their, that leaves no cashflow to build assets.",2023-01-14 08:49:10,j4aiwi1,t3_10bi4zs,/r/germany/comments/10bi4zs/how_are_there_so_many_millionaires_and/j4aiwi1/,31,Positive
washington_jefferson,"About 25k-30k Germans make over 1M€ in salary each year. So, who knows what their partner makes as well. If you have over 500k netto each year, it would be easy to invest that money, and investments are taxed differently than salaries. Also, when people say ""millionaire"" or ""billionaire"" that includes businesses. A family boss who owns a small successful business could be a ""millionaire"" and they could lose it all in one year. Elon Musk ""lost"" $200B in about a few months, for example.

Adventurous-String38,"The 45% are the highest tax rate on marginal income - so even if you reach the additional income where that rate applies, the first couple of thousands you earn will be tax free so the effective tax rate is a bit lower.

Many ""paper millionnaires"" have been made by rising real estate prices: 15 years ago, you could buy a nice large flat in a good location in Berlin for around € 400 k which would have taken you to millionnaire status by now while living rent-free and renewing your mortgage at low rates in between. After 3 years of living in such a flat, gains made from the sale would be tax free.

Even without a real estate boom, becoming a millionnaire is feasible in Germany - it just takes time and discipline. Take 15 to 20 per cent of your net income and invest in reasonably valued stock regularly (strictly no YOLOing there!) and let it compound and you'll get there over time.

This question seems a bit silly frankly. First keep in mind that even progressive taxation has a limit and there are often tax breaks if one runs a business a certain way or chooses to have a family etc. like you claim to run a business that has socially aware policies like hiring disabled , POC , refugees or schemes for poor people and what not not only will govt not tax you but they will throw money at you themselves. This is literally how Germanys “semi-welfare” state works also given that things like healthcare, transportation and insurances are still private in nature but all they have to do is not screw over the poor like they get to do in USA and still earn nicely 😊. 

Let’s take a single person who happens to be earning say 500,000 € per Annum legally and under the watchful eye of tax authorities. If he gives about 45 to 50%  tax on that he is still left with 250,000€ approx and the regular living costs are not very different either. Even if he chooses to like live it out in a huge house , party often and what not he won’t spend more than 100k and the rest he can put in stocks and voila in few years he is a millionaire 

German banking also LOVE rich people so much that it’s actually more profitable and less expensive to do banking when you are rich as opposed to poor.

__doodiemann__,"I had the same question when I came to Germany. I see no way for me to create wealth in Germany, especially as an outsider. But now I think at least I can have some informed guesses why:

* It's impossible to get rich by working in Germany and paying 42-45% off in taxes.
* A lot of rich people had an inheritance and money makes more money.
* Most startups are coming from big companies where a few might get richer. Germany doesn't have a great startup culture where anyone can create a company and build something big.
* A lot of people building businesses register their company in tax heavens or lesser taxed countries (Ireland, Luxemburg, Cyprus, Dubai, etc)

So yeah, working a job even earning a very good salary like 100K+ salary a year won't end up in a good amount of savings after paying so much in taxes and contributions.

tealeg,"I mean, it's pretty clear - even at 45% income tax, you're still keeping 55% of what you earn above that threshold - so if your income is 2m euros, you'll already be keeping more than a million euros in income (and that's even before your start working on your tax returns to avoid some of that tax).  People don't get demotivated by high-taxation - they'll still try to get rich :-D

It's actually not true that this is a high rate of taxation BTW - if you live in Portland, Oregon, the highest marginal rate of taxation (federal, state and city combined) is 51.6%, and many European countries (including the UK, France, Holland and all of the Nordic countries) have a higher maximal marginal rate.    Historically almost all countries had significantly higher rates of tax on high earners than they do now.

Another factor you might not be thinking of is the degree to which taxation is returned to people at the top of the pile.  A country provides a lot of infrastructure that supports business.  Road and rail systems allow the transport of goods, education to provide qualified employees, and welfare to ensure landlords and shop owners have a supply of income even when people are unemployed.  Relatively few businesses can flourish without all those things  - and when governments (or dependent private entities like Deutsche Bahn) stop investing in them there is a substantive effect on the economy.",2023-01-15 04:38:46,j4eqw6o,t3_10bi4zs,/r/germany/comments/10bi4zs/how_are_there_so_many_millionaires_and/j4eqw6o/,1,Positive

This is not true anymore, which is stupid. You are required to declare gains/losses at the end of the year regardless of buying/selling. These are then taxed as capital gains. If you’re stock goes down in value you can use that as credit against income tax.

Also, the government will give you an “expected end of year capital growth” estimate at the start of the year which you must pay quarterly. Your end of year tax declaration then is relative to this, if you overpaid you get a refund, underpaid you get a discount.

atlasbuddha,"This is a little besides your point, of which I agree with, I also was under the assumption that homelessness was more prevalent in the US than in Germany until I saw the statistics. Per 10,000 people [31.4](https://www.bmas.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Soziale-Sicherung/wohnungslosenbericht-2022.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2) are homeless in Germany while in the U.S. it is [17.6](https://www.statista.com/statistics/555795/estimated-number-of-homeless-people-in-the-us/)

There are definitely massive concentrations in the U.S., primarily on the west coast cities like LA, San Francisco, Seattle etc. where taxes and social contributions are ironically higher. People argue this is because it is a “better” climate to be experiencing homelessness in terms of weather, social acceptance, and social benefits. Thus people who are homeless are attracted to these areas if they can move there. Others argue that it is the high cost of living that initiates homelessness in these cities. Most likely a blend of reasonings 

If you believe the statistics as a whole the U.S. is somehow doing better in this regard, maybe the governments count and classify homelessness differently or there is just more attention given to the extreme pockets in the U.S. which creates a narrative, who knows",2023-01-14 10:45:57,j4arf7m,t1_j4adz0d,/r/germany/comments/10bi4zs/how_are_there_so_many_millionaires_and/j4arf7m/,-1,Positive

sdric,"Rental income is subject to tax, but it's relatively low. The governments intention was to set low taxes so that people build more houses and tackle the housing crisis.... Instead it made the housing crisis worse by starting bidding wars on ground until no normal person could afford anymore.

SeniorePlatypus,"There's kinda two answers.

One, if you get weird enough with your international holdings you can repay the company from a different country. So long as you shifted things around without ever triggering the tax or cross financed things enough you can mostly get through it without incurring taxes.

That's part of why tax havens are so bad. The bank doesn't care how you repay but you do get money you can use locally through the credit without taxes. Some banks genuinely advertise to wealthy clients with such tax optimization services. I know Goldman Sachs did some extremely wild stuff. They are also the ones who came up with the way for Greece to fake their books so they can enter the Euro.

And on the other hand, they often don't repay them. It's like juggling credit card debt. So long as you have assets and the bank is willing to lend you money you can keep doing this forever. 

And yes. When a rich person does go bankrupt for some reason it does get quite wild.

washington_jefferson,"Well, [here is an article from Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/how-good-is-germany-to-its-super-rich/a-57617709) that is titled: ""How good is Germany to its super rich?""

The conclusion? Germany is pretty neutral to the super rich. Not so great, not so hurtful.

They link to a page from the The Federal Statistical Office, which says the following:

> Press release No. 232 of 18 May 2021

> WIESBADEN – In 2017, just under 24,700 of all people registered as wage or income tax payers in Germany had an income of at least one million euros. This was an increase of just under 1,900 taxpayers compared with 2016. The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) also reports that the average income of that group was 2.7 million euros. The concentration of millionaires was highest in Hamburg. There, twelve in 10,000 income tax payers subject to unlimited tax liability (1.2 per thousand) had an annual income of more than one million. In both Sachsen-Anhalt and Thüringen, however, this applied to no more than one in 10,000 taxpayers (0.1 per thousand).

So, there you go. I suppose the reaction to the number of loopholes is subjective. You consider the number to be ""incredible"" and I think they are sufficient. You are inferring that there are too many loopholes with inheritance taxes, where I think the government should not be sticking their hands into families' estates that they have built over long periods of time. The inheritance taxes are sufficient. If the government wants to add a 1% or 2% increase to yearly incomes, I would find that reasonable. Estates? No.",2023-01-14 21:19:20,j4d19z2,t1_j4b9u9i,/r/germany/comments/10bi4zs/how_are_there_so_many_millionaires_and/j4d19z2/,0,Positive

Bloody_Barbarian,"While I am a leftist and socialist, I think this view is pretty far from the truth.  
The economic system of capitalism is built in a way that money ""pools"" in certain places.  
And it's often not because someone's actively exploiting someone else (though sometimes it is).  
Very simple example: let's say you work for a big (but not giant, global) company and you make 150k a year.  
That's quite a lot. Not ""stinking rich"", but well off.  
And say you have a friend with a good idea for an invention, but he needs funds to make it happen.   
You give him the money, become his business partner, a few years later his invention is ready, it's a big success, many companies make you offers to use that invention, you take the offers and become millionaires.  
Did you two exploit anyone to get rich?

Also many people have some sort of old life insurance, that pays now inflation adjusted and with 50-60 years payment, you also can come over a million.

rewboss,"It depends on what you're trying to say. If you were trying to say that Germany was the most successful social market economy at narrowing the wealth gap, then your point would have merit.

But that's not my argument. My argument is that social market economies are better than unfettered capitalist economies at narrowing the wealth gap: whether Germany is better or worse than other social market economies isn't relevant. You would thus have to show me that social market economies in general are worse than other economies.

Suppose I showed you a giraffe and told you that giraffes are taller than any other mammal. You can't disprove my argument by showing me giraffes that are even taller: you would have to show me a different species of mammal that is taller.

That's not the same as if I said ""This giraffe is the tallest mammal."" *That* you could disprove very easily by pointing to a taller giraffe.",2023-01-14 19:43:46,j4cn5nq,t1_j4clysc,/r/germany/comments/10bi4zs/how_are_there_so_many_millionaires_and/j4cn5nq/,1,Positive

Meeting the right people at the right time? Coincidence.

Money attracts money.

This ""wisdom"" is already common knowledge.

Bergwookie,"Well, the wage/price ratio rose, but if you're a few decades old, your reference ratio is still on a lower level, so the now million is worth only a half million in your heads money.

I have completely lost the ratio in my head.. 

Also in work, I always could do a rough estimation, what certain things would cost, now you're willing to pay every price for materials, just to get it... It's gotten insane.


We need a stabilisation of prices, so wages can adjust to it... But not in real time, that would lead to a galloping inflation, like you can see in turkey, first there has to be a stability before a normal ratio can be restored.

The numbers don't matter, the true value is manhour/value, if milk costs 5 min of average work, it doesn't matter if that's 5€/h or 500€/h, just inconvenient with bigger numbers.
As long as we don't come back to the times, where it was cheaper to burn bundles of banknotes than buying firewood with them, like in the 1920s (where people needed a wheelbarrow to take their weeks wages home)...

>""Since the early 1970s, the hourly inflation-adjusted wages received by the typical worker have barely risen, growing only 0.2% per year. In other words, though the economy has been growing, the primary way most people benefit from that growth has almost completely stalled.""

Historical_Skin4234,Balance sheet is the only way to not get confused by the bla bla of Wallstreet. Lost is the wrong question because the money is not lost. The money concentrates in the pocket of the one who has the power to say what the price is. Or tell me why the people in the us are getting poorer and the riches getting richer at the same time the riches consuming more and more but the poorer consuming less? The money flows from one to another. It can not duplicate by its self. Real growth when anybody gets a part of can only be when the worker don't need to work more for. It's a fantasy of the wealth. They saying it's getting better but the truth is the people have to work more and more... Or they calculating the inflation down by the cores of an iPhone but the food gets more expensive.

Dub-DS,">being a millionaire is the goalpost here, which you can do by working if you arent lazy or stupid.

In a country where the median income is 2.000€ after taxes per month? You're terribly mistaken. 150k a year (before taxes) is top 1% earners and there are very few regular jobs where you have the chance to earn that much - basically only leading positions in large companies. That's not about being lazy or stupid, in order to land such a job you need to come from a privileged background and be lucky enough to get a chance to score such a position.  


A middle class (2000€ a month) earner will need to spend at least 750€ on living expenses - that is, if you survive and barely live. 1250€ saved a month means 800 months of work to reach a million. That's 67 years, but pension starts at that age and you only start working with 20-23 years, depending on the field. It's never going to happen.  


In fields where being smart is a requirement, you can expect to earn roughly 4-6k€ a month before taxes in fields like health care (doctor), software development, financial advisor. That amounts to 2.5-3.5k a month after taxes. Saving 2k€ a month on average, you'll still have to work for 40 years.

* if you want to create an AG or gmbh you need to be at least 2 people, no? I was looking into gmbh because its cheaper than AG (25k vs 50k initial capital). 

* if you are the vostandsmitglied and you dont have employees, then who is officially doing the work? As i understand it you would have to be both, vostandsmitglied and employee so you can actually perform work. And your employee salary would be taxed accordingly.

So for a single freelancer/contractor its not really feasible, right?

Hope you can shed some light on that, because id really would want to setup something like this, but so far the lawyer i was talking to advised me against it (because of high setup costs and in the end you still have to tax your own employee salary if you want to take out the money from the company to your pocket - for example to pay rent or food).

I wasnt talking about the dude that grazed through uni and finished with a 4.4 Exam and works 35 hours a week. I was talking about working in one of the Großkanzleien. 


>How many law firms are there in Germany that pay this much?

A couple, depends on how you define großkanzleien. The top 10 all range between 140k and 170k in terms of initial salary and they need new fodder for the machine each year. 

>saying ""oh, there are plenty of well paying jobs just work hard and study"" 

I am not saying that. And i never tried to explain the amount of Millionaires with that statement.

What i did say, is, that it is absolutely possible to become objectively rich, and even a millionaire, by working. Granted, you have to more or less work your ass off, especially during uni, but it is possible and attainable for anybody with the right drive and cognitive capacity.

SeniorePlatypus,"Scale is important. But so is using the productivity of others directly, inserting yourself into a process to extract a margin.

As person working alone yet becoming rich there‘s only a few possibilities.

1. You buy products cheap and sell them expensive. You profit from the labor of the people producing the products. 

2. You offer a service to do something where you get a cut or massive margin from someone else utilizing the work of employees for profit (e.g. consultants).

3. You do luxury products or services where clients drastically overpay, using money that has previously been extracted from workers.

5. You leverage existing wealth to utilize material goods that drive serious margins out of nothing. E.g. charging interest on loans, renting out apartments, etc.

4. You have extreme scale of reach and manage to collect donations or commissions from millions for nothing in exchange. This refers to cults, multi level marketing and similar schemes. And direct donations to influencers. 

Direct donations because most money influencers make comes from ads which, as a whole, is an extractive industry. You profit off of others creating something and needing to advertise to sell units. Advertising really works like an arms race in that sense. 

I might have missed an option but generally speaking. They are all leveraging and extractive. As single person you can‘t be productive to a degree where your actual labor makes you rich.

You are correct. There is a tiny niche where it's possible whenever a new phenomenon emerges. When the same dynamics have yet to be established.
