It&#39;s trying to show verticality - &quot;look how tall the gate is&quot; - it&#39;s on a portrait canvas, but at one point, arbitrarily, not at a third, not at the middle (which would&#39;ve been worse, but it&#39;s close to it anyway), there&#39;s a thick horizontal black line highlited by the light that escapes on the floor sideways. I personally think some light from above, gradually becoming weaker on the last few steps would actually improve it - it would mean less work to change it instead of moving the whole thing lower or going through trial and error and changing the camera view to achieve a better composition.</p>\n</div>",

And i think its because the tiles on the floor look to big compared to the character...so id say try to make the tiles blend together better so they dont stand out as &#39;tiles&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Also i think maybe try keeping the camera a bit lower in terms of height from ground. As in like jus make it a bit closer to the ground so the entrance looks even more grander( im not entirely sure if this camera thing will look better or not so its ur call)</p>\n\n<p>If u want some references then search up &#39;shadow fight 2 gate opening scene&#39;...it looks similar to yours</p>\n</div>",

A Barbie doll on a dark garage floor? The color and lighting seem evoke similar \"big epic space\" imagery, so it's a fair guess to say \"big, awe-inspiring space\" was the goal, but other elements-- the scale of the texture on the floor, the height of the \"step\", the lack of atmospheric distance cues, and the high angle looking down that would make more sense at small scale-- point to small-scale.\n\nIf I'm assuming the \"small-scale\" interpretation, it's not an interesting scene on its own. Yes, I know it's all moving models around, but on a visual, suspended-belief basis, a massive monolith towering toward the sky is still more interesting than a sugar cube, even if both are just scaled default cubes. It's a reproduction of something rather mundane-- a Barbie doll on a garage floor. There's not enough guidance or allusion to make a compelling narrative of why the Barbie doll is on the garage floor, and it's all in silhouette, so it doesn't have the detail to be interesting on its own as a faithful reproduction of something mundane.\n\nIf it's meant to be a \"large-scale\" picture (after adding proper cues to make the space look large and looming), it does have the awe of large spaces going for it, but it still skirts the same problems of lacking either narrative or demonstration. While it wouldn't suffer the \"So what?\" of being reproducible with five minutes in a garage, it's still not providing a story about why it's important or a demonstration of something that's unimportant but interesting.\n\nUltimately, I think the first course of action is to visit or revisit the questions \"Why is this picture?\" or \"What is this a picture of?\", ensure that that's compelling enough as an elevator pitch alone, and build the scene to faithfully serve that pitch.",
